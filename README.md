**Author**: JodyAnn Bradford 

### Business problem:

### Data:

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

### Content:
A mobile company, wants to give a tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

They do not know how to estimate the prices for mobile phone in their company. To solve this problem the company collects sales data of mobile phones from various companies.

They want to find out if some relationship exist between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price.

## Methods
- The dataset used for model building contained 2000 rows of 21 columns. 

- The methods used are data cleaning, visualization graphs, preprocessing, imputing(simple imputer), and various classification methods in python. Specifically logistic regression, K-Nearest neighbors, Feature engineering(PCA) and Confusion metrics

## Model

The final model chosen is the decision tree classifier without PCA. The mobile price range for all new companies is critical to their branding, and quality matters to consumers. The stakeholder's interest in the ram speed with correlation to the price range is noteworthy. It turns out that the better ram speed in a phone equates to better, faster data. In addition to switching between apps(gadgetsnow.com). I chose the accuracy of the model to be the deciding factor for the stakeholders. Out of the logistic regression model, KNN means model and the decision tree model.
